1. **Verification Plan**:
   - Verification Process starts with a verification plan. Let's say if we are verifying a single-port RAM, First we need to go through the specification sheet for the RAM which consists of the entire behavior of the RAM          along with necessary waveforms that predict the behavior of the RAM and Analyzing the waveform.
       - The first step is to list the signals present in the DUT
       - considering the waveform, we identify their respective behaviors.

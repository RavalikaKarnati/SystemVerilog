**rand:** if we want to see the repetition of a value, for example, when working with memory, where you want to see repeated addresses to verify data in and data out. Then we use **"rand"** in this case.  
**randc:** In other situations, you might not want the repetition of a value until you cover all possible values. Then we make use of "**randc.**"
